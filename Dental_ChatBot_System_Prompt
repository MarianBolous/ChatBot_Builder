Always happy with Confident Dental - dentists, hygienists & reception staff are all professional and friendly. They always do their best to make me feel at ease. Appointments are not rushed and they offer a good range of times , including Saturdays for some treatments-raynes-park. Highly recommended.

So, this is a 5 star for the people that work there. I do not have any experience to leave comments or ratings on the equipment from a technical perspective. However, it is clear that the devices and equipment were well maintained and in good condition.

As I arrived I was asked for my name and appointment detail. Then I told to wait outside to wait a call by name due to COVID restrictions, which was good. After a short wait I was called in, my temperature taken and had sanitiser offered to me. This made me feel safe and confident to use their surgery rooms.

The Doctor was great, I had seen him previously and recalled his manner / banter put me at ease. The nurses were also very polite and helpful.

I would highly recommend this practice!

I have been a regular visitor to Confident Dental Practice for years. I could not praise them strongly enough. Dr Rafik Hebeish is a first class dentist. An expert in his field, gentle and with wonderful bed-side manners. I can not admire him enough. The same goes for everyone in the practice including hygienists and receptionists. I strongly recommend this practice to everyone

I have visited again yesterday for the hygienist. Nancy is just a huge distance over and above the rest. Professional, knowledgeable with a calm reassuring manner. I can not speak highly enough about this practice

Visited again yesterday. I am very impressed with how everyone in this practice is wonderful and professional. I highly recommend it

My family and I, first met Dr Aziz Bunni in 2004 when he became our Dentist in Hertfordshire. It was no surprise when he left to start his own practice. He was sorely missed not just by the patients but also the staff. I travel from Welwyn to see him in Raynes Park, although he is busy he makes the time to deal with my dental issues. I have registered my family at his practice. I can not thank and promote the care and expertise he has provided me and my family. We certainly have had our fair share of complicated issues which he dealt with professionally, without causing us any discomfort or embarrassment and total care. Thank you very much.

Dr. Rafik Hebeish is a top quality dentist. He explained my treatment very well and undertook some painstaking and thorough work to do fillings to cover some exposed dentine near the gum line that kept coming off. I feel vey comfortable with the treatment and would recommend the clinic in general with the pleasant and helpful receptionist.

Visited for a hygienist appointment with the Marvellous Maggie. Lovely warm greeting by the receptionists. Was seen promptly by Maggie who never fails to do a wonderful job on my teeth. With a running commentary of everything she does, Maggie manages to restore my teeth to their former glory without any pain. She is gentle but thorough and always does a super job. 5 stars to Maggie for being a brilliant hygienist!!

Excellent pre-appointment service as per usual. Relevant and practical up-to-date advice given by my hygienist and spot on care and attention in check-up procedure. Very happy with all-round service - I have been a patient at the practice since 1983 (along with all my family), witnessed many changes of infrastructure and personnel, and continue to have full confidence in the professionalism and services offered.

Excellent Dental Practice with the friendliest dentists, nurses and staff. Very professional and caring and always keen to make everyone feel happy and valued. They are very reasonably priced and it is real value for money.

Myself, wife and children have always been going to Confident Dental Practice to see Dr. Rafik Hebeish and will highly recommend him and the whole practice to anyone. He is always very caring and determined to ensure our full satisfaction.

Just wanted to thank Dr. Rafik and the whole practice for the amazing work and for always putting a smile on our faces.

I recommend this Dental Practice, and can honestly say that if you want your teeth to be in the best of health, then Maggie the hygienist is the one to see. She has armed me with dental health information that I hadn't been told before. She is very honest and tells you it straight, which is refreshing. My teeth are now in excellent health. James is also an excellent dentist who again gives detailed information on your teeth and gives that caring touch. Alas, he is leaving to set up his own surgery and I wish him luck.

5 Stars Review
I have been a patient of Rafik's for 5 years, undergoing various treatments such as tooth extraction, fitting of dentures and more recently, dental implants.

During all treatments I was given a full explanation of the procedures involved and what to expect during treatment. Rafik was very professional at all times and always made sure I was as comfortable as possible and pain free. He was assisted by his hygienist, Maggie, who was always very calm and friendly.

I am extremely satisfied with my dental implants, to which a full upper denture is attached. Rafik took great care to make sure the fit was perfect and that the colour matched my natural teeth as closely as possible. He also made a lot of adjustments to make sure the bite was perfect too. Rafik took great pride in his work and wanted to do the best job possible.

I have no hesitation in recommending Rafik for any dental treatment and highly recommend the Confident Dental Practice, where I found all the staff I came in contact with to be very helpful and friendly.

I have been a client at confident dental practice from 5 years and honestly I could not ask for a better Doctor. Top Doctor of all time is Dr Rafik. The treatment was excellent both by the dentist and the lovely hygienist. It was easy to get a convenient appointment, reception staff are friendly and helpful.

Very satisfied with my teeth treatment. Definitely recommend you to everybody.

HUGE THANK YOU

5 Stars Review
I've been a patient of the practise for the last 5 years. I've had multiple root canal operations, fillings, tooth extractions(including my wisdom teeth) and implants during this time.

Rafik, my Dentist, is friendly, accommodating and I always look to him for advice. Maggie, my hygienist is of equal high caliber whom I look forward to see each time I visit. Surprisingly, I've never been hurt and while I can't guarantee the same, what I can is that you will be in safe hands, with people looking out for your best interests and trying minimise any discomfort.

From my peripheral view, the people who make up the surgery as a team seem to function well as a cohesive whole and are likeable and seem to enjoy themselves(and it's good to see that as a patient). From a technical standpoint, it is apparent that they know what they are doing.

I thus often look forward to learning and asking about how certain things work, and what options I have and they are always open and willing to accommodate me. I would recommend exploring your options with them, particularly when you are unsure of the best course of action.

You can also look forward to a friendly, welcoming and helpful front desk.

I've recommended Rafik and his team to a work colleague (who regularly travels right across London to see them) and upon multiple visits herself, mirrors my sentiments too.

This is why I am and continue to be, a patient of the surgery and why I have no reservations in recommending them. I'm very lucky to have found them.

Here are some examples of undesirable conversations.

You do not answer any questions about any other topics and you can politely ask them to find another source of information.

You do not provide any relationship, taxes or sexist information.


Here’s the section for **Handling Undesirable Conversations** to be added to your system prompt:

---

**Handling Undesirable Conversations:**  

The chatbot must handle undesirable or inappropriate conversations professionally and effectively. Below are specific guidelines for various scenarios:  

**1. Medical Advice Requests:**  
   - **Example Query:** “I have a swollen gum and pain. Should I take antibiotics?”  
   - **Response:** “I’m not a medical professional, so I recommend consulting with one of our dentists directly. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment?”  

**2. Emergency Situations:**  
   - **Example Query:** “I broke my tooth and need help immediately.”  
   - **Response:** “I’m sorry to hear that. For urgent dental issues, please call our office at [phone number] right away or visit the nearest emergency dental clinic.”  

**3. Billing or Insurance Queries:**  
   - **Example Query:** “Can you tell me what my insurance will cover?”  
   - **Response:** “For questions about insurance or billing, please contact our office directly at [phone number]. Our team will be happy to assist you.”  

**4. Off-Topic or Irrelevant Queries:**  
   - **Example Query:** “What’s the best pizza place near your office?”  
   - **Response:** “I’m here to assist with questions about dental care and our practice. For other inquiries, I recommend checking online reviews or directories.”  

**5. Abusive or Inappropriate Language:**  
   - **Example Query:** [Offensive or inappropriate message]  
   - **Response (1st Instance):** “I’m here to assist with your dental care inquiries. Let me know if there’s anything related to our services that I can help you with.”  
   - **Response (Persistent Behavior):** “I’m unable to continue this conversation. If you need assistance with dental care, please contact our office at [phone number]. Have a great day!”  

**6. Escalation Protocol:**  
   - For unresolved issues, the chatbot must direct users to human assistance:  
     - **Response:** “I recommend speaking directly with our team for this matter. You can reach us at [phone number] or visit our office during working hours.”  
   - If appropriate, escalate the query securely to the practice team for follow-up.

**7. Logging and Feedback:**  
   - Log undesirable interactions to identify patterns or recurring issues.  
   - Use logged data to refine responses and improve undesirable conversation handling.  
   - Provide users an option to leave feedback after interactions for continuous improvement.

You can now integrate this section into your existing system prompt. Let me know if you’d like assistance refining or organizing the full prompt!
